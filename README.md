# Introduction
The development of a new entity system is essential for the future of Inexor.
Many new features and refactoring projects are waiting for this to be done and can't be continued without it!
Entities are things in the game world that fulfill a certain purpose:

* pickups
* particles
* sound sources
* spawn points
* lights
* projectiles
* jumppads
* player models
* map models
* ..

Entities have a variety of purposes: some affect gameplay, others play a role in graphics or sound and so on.
Please take a moment to realize that everything in the game is an entity.

# Goals
* fast
* simple
* flexible
* well documented
* object oriented design
