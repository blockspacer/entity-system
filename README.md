# Introduction
The development of a new entity system is an essential key for the future of Inexor!
It is the foundation for many new features like the new particle system,
the new sound system or the visual scripting enviroment. It also plays a central role in code refactoring.
All those tasks can't be started until a new entity system has been developed!
In order to accelerate Inexor's development we must resolve this blocking of follow-up projects as fast as possible!

## What is an entity ?
An entity is a thing in the game world that fulfills a certain purpose:

* pickups
* particles
* sound sources
* spawn points
* lights
* projectiles
* jumppads
* player models
* map models
* ..

Please take a moment to realize that *everything* in the game is an entity.

# What are the implementation metrics ?
* fast
* simple
* flexible
* well documented
* object oriented design
